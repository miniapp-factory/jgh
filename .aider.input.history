+Jump & Dodge is a survival running game where your character automatically moves forward, and you must tap to jump over obstacles while avoiding traps and falling objects. Each successful jump increases your distance score, while hitting an obstacle ends the run instantly. As the speed increases, the timing becomes tighter and obstacles appear with unpredictable patterns, pushing your reflexes to the limit. Players must stay alert, react instantly, and time their jumps perfectly to survive longer and beat their previous best distance. Simple controls and endless gameplay make Jump & Dodge a highly addictive challenge for players of all ages.
